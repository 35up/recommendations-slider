# Example of using recommendations slider in Fake Door Testing

If you want to conduct Fake Door Testing with 35up recommendations in order
to measure the interest of the customers to cross selling products, use this
repo as an example implementation. 

The idea is that there is a 35up recommendations slider connected to a modal 
dialog. When user clicks "Add to cart" button or on the recommendation product 
(text or image) the modal dialog is opened where you could reveal to the user
that this feature is still in progress and simultaneously collect this event
using your analytics tool.
